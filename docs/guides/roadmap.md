# Roadmap

## Intro

Not everything on this list will be implemented, and some items not on this list might be implemented. The journey to 1.0 will invite decisions which could alter the behavior and structure of Jawaf. So be forewarned this could get quite flexible.
It is very possible this project will end up being more an idea than anything concrete - an invitation towards what could be.

This is divided into sections:

`Road to 1.0.0` is the more or less official list of upcoming items per release.

`Unversioned ToDo List` items not attached to an upcoming version.

`Unlikely` is a list of items that have been evaluated and won't likely make it into the core for 1.0.

## Road to 1.0.0

### 0.5.0

#### Files
    * Support for files (local/AWS/etc)

#### Security
    * Take a fresh look at security

## Unversioned ToDo List

## Unlikely

#### DB Support
    * [Mysql](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiomysql)

#### Messaging
    * [Kafka](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiokafka)?

#### Tests
    * testing.postgresl instead of actual postgres as an option
